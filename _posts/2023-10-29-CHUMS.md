It's a user-friendly community platform that allows you to sign in, share your passions and interests, and get personalized event recommendations. With CHUMS, you can easily find and join meetups with people who share your interests. Platform was fully deployed in cloud environment, allowing to configure it to work smoothly in any region!

## What is the purpose of CHUMS?
CHUMS was created in order to lend society a helpful hand, so they could reach out to others and socialize while exploring their passions. Loneliness and boredom are two serious issues that have arised after COVID epidemy, after which people choose to stay home over reaching out to others to meet. Even though CHUMS is a product for everyone, we especially aim at these who might be too shy or unmotivated to try going out and socializing with others.
