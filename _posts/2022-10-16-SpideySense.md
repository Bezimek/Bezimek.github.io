## About SpideySense - We watch out for you
SpideySense project was created during Best Hacks 2022 Hackathon by FlowChain team and was awarded 2nd place! Project aimed to support ones that suffer from sight related issues and blindness, augmenting their perception using our AI powered application that analyzes their surroundings (using mounted camera on their belt or chest) and notifying them on dangers (like holes in sidewalk, being too close to street etc.) or interesting points (like crosswalks).


## What is the purpose of SpideySense?
Purpose of SpideySense is to give people with sight and/or hearing disabilities an opportunity to move around cities and towns with much more comfort and safety, especially in places that hadn't invested in improvements like marked crosswalks (the ones with special pavement that allows them identify the crosswalk). This would not only ensure their safety but what is more important, would increase their quality of life by giving them new way "to see" the world!
