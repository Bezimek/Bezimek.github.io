## About eRatownik - Each minute counts!
During our first Hackathon when FlowChain emerged, we managed to gain 5th place with our project eRatownik! These days first aid is crucial and each minute counts. Hence we focused on ensuring smooth and quick communication between ambulances and hospitals, allowing rescuers know in advance which hospitals provide proper equipment and enough places. This could save precious time, as they wouldn't need to call hospitals themselves (which is common practice in Poland currently) and just see on our map which hospitals were available for them.

## What is the purpose of eRatownik?
COVID pandemy proved us how unprepared we were for such kind of catastrophes and hospitals quite quickly got overrun with people in need. Lacking in beds, equipment and staff they couldn't hold many patients, while ambulances had issues finding place where they could leave their patients. To reduce that time significantly in the future and now, we wanted to offer our solution eRatownik, that would allow ambulances choose hospitals that are less crowded and evenly distribute people in need between them, so everyone could get equal amount of care they deserve.

## Features

### Maintaining hospitals databases
Hospitals are given a new way to fill information about their units, available rooms and beds. App also offer possibility to share what kind of equipment (and how many) they have available, so patients with special needs would get medical care they require.

### Reservation system
Our system allows ambulances to book place in chosen hospital, so it would prevent situation when several ambulances would arrive the same place trying to put all their patients in one bed. Moreover, ambulances have option to choose a priority of their patient (for instance patients in critical conditions would be let first), ensuring instant medical care for those who really need it.
